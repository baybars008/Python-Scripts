Script Description:

This script serves the purpose of removing lines from a text file up to a specified line number, and then it saves the remaining lines in a new output file.

How to Use the Script:

1) Save the Script:
Save this script file (the Python code) in the same directory as the text file you want to process. Alternatively, you can specify the correct path to your text file in the input_file variable within the script.

2) Specify Output File Name:
In the script, there is a variable named output_file. Replace "new_text_file.txt" with the desired name of the output file where the processed content will be saved. You can keep it as is or change it according to your preference.

3) Run the Script:
Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.
Navigate to the directory where you saved the script and your input text file using the cd command (change directory). For example:

    cd path/to/your/directory

Execute the script by running the following command:


    python script_name.py

Replace script_name.py with the actual name of your Python script file.

4) Provide Input:

When you run the script, it will prompt you to enter the line number up to which you want to remove lines. Enter a valid line number that falls within the range of lines in your text file. If you enter an invalid number, the script will display an "Invalid line number" message and exit without making changes.

5) Result:

After the script executes successfully, it will process the file, remove lines up to the specified line number, and save the remaining lines in the output file you specified earlier.

6) Confirmation Message:

The script will provide a confirmation message indicating that lines up to the specified line number have been removed.

Please make sure to have a backup of your original text file, as this script makes permanent changes to the file it processes.
